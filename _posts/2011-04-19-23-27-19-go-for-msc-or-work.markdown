Q: Msc or not
---------

* Only apply for ones you like
* If it is not the one you like, Msc doesn't bring you much more value than working experience
* If you target to work in China, I guess it would be different. <br/> (I don't have enough information to advice)
* Anyway, do part time master is enough, don't spend too much effort on it

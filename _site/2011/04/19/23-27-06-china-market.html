<h2 id='q_china_market'>Q: China Market</h2>

<p>broad topic. I can see several things happening:</p>

<ul>
<li>SZ and Hong Kong have to merge together to compete SH and BJ</li>

<li>Hong Kong and China has to catch up latest technologies</li>

<li>China weak in standards and law enforcement</li>

<li>Hong Kong too focus on financial system</li>
</ul>
